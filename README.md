# Voice-Agents
I created an interactive voice agent that can answer questions, guide conversations, and provide information using ElevenLabs.io's free voice agent platform. I built a knowledge base, design conversation flows, and tested my agent - all without writing code.
# Voice Agents Lab – Campus Info Assistant

## Project Overview
This project documents the creation of a **voice-based Campus Info Assistant** using the ElevenLabs interface. The agent is designed to help students quickly get answers to common campus-related questions by routing them to the correct support area, such as technical support or billing support. The goal of this project was to explore how conversation branching, knowledge bases, and eagerness settings affect the behavior and usefulness of a voice agent.

## Reflection Questions

### **1. Branch Design Challenge**
The most challenging part of designing the conversation branches was making sure the agent asked enough questions to understand the user’s issue without overwhelming them. I had to balance how eager the agent was to route the user versus how patient it needed to be to gather accurate details. Through this process, I learned that voice agents work best when conversation paths are clearly defined but still flexible. If branches are too rigid, the agent can misunderstand the user, but if they are too open, the agent may take longer to reach a useful solution.

### **2. Knowledge Base Impact**
The knowledge base had a major impact on the quality of the agent’s responses. Adding structured, specific content, such as step by step troubleshooting instructions or explanations of billing charges helped the agent give clearer and more accurate answers. I noticed that practical, action-oriented content worked better than vague descriptions. For example, technical support steps and billing explanations were more useful than general definitions because they directly guided the user toward resolving their issue.

### **3. Real-World Application**
A voice agent like this would be extremely useful in a **college or university setting**, especially for student support services. It could reduce the workload on help desks by answering common questions about login issues, tuition payments, or refunds. Beyond education, this type of agent could also be valuable in industries like healthcare, customer service, or banking, where users often need fast answers and guided assistance without waiting on hold to speak with a representative.

## Conclusion
This lab helped me better understand how voice agents use branching logic, knowledge bases, and eagerness settings to handle real conversations. Designing this agent showed how AI can improve accessibility and efficiency in real-world support environments.
